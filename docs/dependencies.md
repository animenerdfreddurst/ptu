# Project Dependencies (and what they are used for)

## jQuery UI (js/jquery-ui.js, css/jquery-ui.css)

**Purpose:** Autocomplete functionality (`.autocomplete(...)`) is used for:
- Character sheet: Held item input
- Pokemon sheet: Held item + Pokeball inputs  
- Charactermancer: Species field

**Note:** Icon CSS rules are unused (and broken as pngs are missing) but harmless. Autocomplete styling is custom (css/character-sheet.css).
